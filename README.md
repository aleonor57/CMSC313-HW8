PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE: Create an implimentation of a matrix library in both C++ and C.

FILES:
- matrixCPP.h - Header file for the C++ implimentation
- matrixCPP.cpp - C++ implimentation of the matrix library 
- matrixC.h - Header file for the C implimentation
- matrixC.c - C implimentation of the matrix library
     
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS: 
- Download files
- Compile the c and cpp files using the terminal command "g++ FILENAME -o EXENAME"
- Run with ./EXENAME

TESTING METHODOLOGY: 
- Tested individual functions with different value matrices
- Tested cases for square and nonsquare matrices
- Tested overloaded multiply function for scalar and matrix multiplication
